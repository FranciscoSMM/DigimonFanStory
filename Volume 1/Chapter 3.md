# Chessboard Tyrant:

Io was disoriented. When she opened her eyes she could only see shapes and colors around her, as well as mutterings of what sounded like people, not long after that she fainted again. Finally, Io woke up in what seemed to be a luxurious victorian style room. She was laying down a kingsized bed decorated with luxurious red courtains with golden finishings. To be honest, she was already used to seeing settings like those, but mostly in older people's mansions, as hers was more modern. However, this time, she definetly wasn't home, or in the house of anyone she knew, because there were weird chess related furnitures and paintings. But, even then, the wierdest thing of them all was the presence of a big white dog with pinkish bangs hanging besides her.
Io flinched, startled by that dog, who actually responded:

> Master, you're awake, awesome, that is so good, wow!

Their tail was wiggling as they put their paws on the bedside to look at Io better.

> W-wait, you are... From that game? Who are you?

> Oh, how rude of me, master. My name is Labramon, at your service.

> Huh? Why?

> Oh, you see, yesterday I heard a call, a call inside me which said I had to come here for I was supposed to be with you, to be your partner somehow. On my way to this kingdom I found you laying unconscius on the side of the road and decided to bring you here. I was surrounded by guards and told them the story, but they did not believe me, only lord Bishopchessmon did, for no one besides the royalty knew you were here he said. So yeah, I've been watching you, waiting.

>Uh, ok I guess, but why am I here? I was skiing with my parents and stopped to check my phone for a bit and now I'M HERE? Why?

Labramon hesitated, he didn't know how to answer that, neither of them knew why Io was there and she was getting upset, not at Labramon, but at the situation as a whole. And he could see it, he was embarassed for not knowing why, even having his tail stop and be close to his body. His nervouness, lasted only for a moment, as Io hopped off the bed, grabbed her coat, which she noticed had been hanged beside the door and said:

> Well, Let's go then, Labramon. I need to find out what is happening in here.

The digimon was surprised, but he saw the girl was serious and since she asked him specifically, he felt like he was an already trusted companion. Then, they both stormed off the bedroom just to be met by four pawnchessmons guarding the room. Surprisingly, Io simply walked by them and Labramon reluctantly followed but, of course, those four little guys got startled.

> Hey, Halt! Hey! You can't leave your room! Miss, HEY!!!

They were all shouting and trying to pick up the pace with Io, but she answered:

> I can't leave? Says who?

Io had a serious face, an expression she usually demonstrated, specially when things weren't going her way.

> The king says!

> And Bishopchessmon as well!

Io raised an eyebrow.

> Good, then now all of you gentlemen are escorting me to this Bishopchessmon everyone keeps talking about.

The pawnchessmons found the offer reasonable, specially after she called them gentlemen, if you could look beneath their helmets a person could definetly notice they were blushing. And now, with a new formation, Io was being escorted by 4 gentleman and a partner through the hallways of the castle.
Soon, they reached the doors of a what seemed to be an immense room and the pawnchessmons stood all in front of it.

> We're sorry miss, but now you must wait here as we ask permission to enter. Nothing much, but we can't simply barge in, we hope you understand.

> Surerly my good sir, I'm familiar with these kind of procedures.

One of those little pawns scuttled their way into the room and after a while, they came back anouncing that Io and Labramon were allowed to enter. Inside, there was a similarly luxurious room, but it was decorated as a library instead. In it's middle there was a enormous table, full of stacks of papers; several picodevimons were flying around, carrying scrolls, books, pens and other tools. All of that in service of the one who sat at that table, Bishopchessmon.
As the child entered the room, only he looked up and by waving his hand, commanded all the picodevimons to stop.

> So YOU are the chosen one huh? I am Bishopchessmon, advisor and right hand to our great king. How have the servants of this kingdom treated you so far?

> Er, hm I'm Io, but chosen one? Please, don't start with this. But what I must say is that these pawnchessmons here have helped me enough to get hare so yeah, they are nice. But YOU, what is your deal? Why did you bring me here? Just to start this weird conversation?

Labramon seemed concerned. At that point, he knew Bishopchessmon was a high authority figure and that could result in his "master" being sent to jail, or worse. However, Bishopchessmon simply laughed:

> MUAHAHAHAHAHAH! What an amusing guest we have here, my servants... Girl, do you have any idea who you are to us? We didn't "bring" you here, you CAME to us. You fell down from the sky through an enormous beam of light. The savior we needed for this kingdom! Someone who can guide our lord Kingchessmon to everlasting prosperity!

> What?

> Pardon me chone one, I seem to have got too excited about your presence and forgot to slow it down and properly introduce you to our beloved kingdom. Would you acompany me through a tour of our castle as I explain the situation?

> I... Hm I, sure.

Io was thingking she could try and ask more questions if they got out of there, but her head hurt and she was thinking maybe she actually fell from the sky. 
And then, after loking down and receiving a positive shrug from Labramon, they all left the room and started to walk. During this time, Bishopchessmon explained that the king, Kingchessmon, had been extremely out of touch with his kingdom since the queen, Queenchessmon, died last year. Bishopchessmon proceeded to say that even with him as his right hand, the king couldn't lead anymore and the lack of a proper ruler was leading the nation to stagnate in many fronts. "The king even said that he didn't want another queen, but someone who could take on his legacy", the cleric explained as they were passing through windows that lead to a beatiful promenade in front of the castle.
Io knew she was always meant to be a leader, her parents paid pro extracurricular classes to help her understand more about companies processes and functions, in hopes for her, one day to take over their own empire. And she was worried about that as well, for how could she go back to her family? "Even if I were to help here, they don't seem to know a way for me to go back after". For some reason the thoughts of staying there were already on her mind. For a moment there, Io didn't feel in control of her own thoughts and covered up her eyes with her hand.

> Master, are you alright?

Said Labramon, as he clearly seemed concerned for Io's health. After that, Bishopchessmon quickly extended his hand offering support for the girl.

> Chosen One, it seems that this bombardment of information and pleas have overwhelmed you. You must go back to your room and rest, please. Your labramon servant shall acompany you as I start making peparations for your diner and later relaxation moments, so don't you worry.

> I... Sure, I guess, I feel very tired anyway. We'll talk later it seems. Let's go Labramon.

> Yes Master!

Io and her partner went back to the room, she was resting her hand on top of Labramon's head as they walked. It seemed that if that whole thing wasn't just a weird religious cult, it would take some time for her to uncover completely.

***

On the next day, Io and Labramon were offered tours throughout the kingdom once again. Bishopchessmon was sure to mention many times of how the king's influence was fading and people were becoming unruly and more violent with time. Io was very skeptical at first, but as they explored the country, many people seemed angry at them, throwing things, trying to destroy their carriage and other dangerous acts.

> You see Chosen One, we need someone to save this country, to put these people in line. Make justice!

The last word caught Io's attention. She was usually obsessed with the idea of not letting anyone be treated unfairly and have people pay for their wrong doings and the way they were being treated during that day, definetly made her feel something needed to be done.
Her strong feelings for justice were sensed by Labramon, who in turn, said:

> Master, I can feel it too, I think, I think we need to help these people. Maybe we can do it, I believe in you.

> ...

>Worry not our four-legged friend, master Io will come to her senses as well.

Io looked bothered, she was conflicted because she felt like she shouldn't act so hastly, but the thoughts of needing to help were flooding her mind.

> We should at least be talking to the people to understand their needs, no?

> OOOOHH master Io, we are, unfortunatedely, past that point. When we reached to the populace to heed their calls, we could only hear the claims you can right now. They want our death and won't take no for an answer. That is why we fortified the castle even more! We NEED to solve this problem.

>... Isn't there a way to do it in a more controlled way then? Like a public hearing with people on a line or something. So you can at least know what the people need fixed?

> What an astouding idea! You are most defintely born for this! Quickly, driver, return to the castle at once and let's prepare for the next step cleasing our kingdom!

> Hmmm...

On the following couple of days, they prepared the main hall to serve as some sort of court room, where Bishopchessmon would sit on it's center, while a long red rug would lead people one by one from the entrance to the table in order for them to be heard one by one.
Io, Labramon, the picodevimons and many other types of digimon all wearing noble clothes were sitting down on fancy but improvised tribunes on the sides. They spent all morning watching and hearing digimons come in, sepak their mind about the problems of the kindgom, sometimes have their needs met right away, but some were dragged there to plea innocence for their crimes. The girl took notes of some of the complaints, trying to figure out patterns of problems the people had. Io was serious in helping them now and right after noon, while lunching, she began tho check her notes with Labramon.

> Hmmm, that's weird Labramon, all these complaints seem like the kingdom simply has no organization, as if people have no government system to follow or...

Before Labramon could answer, Bishopchessmon approached the pair.

> Exactly my girl, now you've seen the reality of our realm and I'm sad that I do not have the power to change it alone. This afternoon I will show you more, this time, the criminals of ou...

> I wanna see the king, now.

Bishopchessmon was with his arms opened, making it seem like he was about to start a long sermon. But, when the girl spoke, he immediately stopped and replied:

> Surely, Choosen One. You shall witness our frailing lord, surely he will give yo uinsights about this situation that I cannot.

He then, lead the the pair through more hallways into the castle, eventually arriving at an inside garden, where light shone beautiful trees, grass, a grave and a couple of heavy chests, those which you woul'd usually see carrying gold, trinkets and baubles. In its center, near the grave, there was a kingchessmon kneeling down. He was malnourished and had a gloom look on his face.

> This is our almighty king, Kingchessmon.

Said Bishopchessmon almost whispering.

> My king, I'm sorry to interrupt thy mourning, but I bring forth Io, the child who arrived from the starts and Labramon, who saved her and pledged eternal loyalty to her.

Io and Labramon step forward while Bishopchessmon leaves the garden room. A couple of seconds pass when the king finally turns around and faces the kids, but he doesn't say anything.

> K-king? I'm Io, as Bishopchessmon said I-I came from afar and I'm trying to help the kingdom, since maybe after you guys could help me go back home.

>... Oh, you are the chosen one... Bishopchessmon told me about you. How according to an old prophecy, a child could lead us to a prosperous future... So are you here to bestow upon me the sweet kiss of death?

> W-What? No! I'm here to help you get back on your feet!

> Oh child, I really hope you never have to go through losing the person you love most in the world and not even from a break up, but from DEATH... Woe is me... I can even see I've lost my mind, that my will is broken and my body is not fit for work anymore.

Kingchessmon started to cry why kneeling down.

> My image upholds importance and my deeds once let this kingdom to great glory. Please take my hand, let me pass on the torch to you. Only a new leader can take on this responsibility, please...

Io reaches for the kings hand, but quickly exitates.

> I... No I... I cannot, I'm not ready, I can't.

Kingchessmon crawled trying to reach for the girl, but before he could insist in touching the girls hand, a shadowy figure descended from the top of the garden, knocking down the old man and with a swift strike, they cut his throat open.

> Death to the Monarchy! Death to Tyrants!!

Labramon immediately bit down Ios jacket and pulled her back, right before the firgure revealed themselves to be a Yaksamon wearing a hooded cape and a metallic shortsword instead of their normal wooden weaponry. 

> Your Highness! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Io screams trying to reach teh fading body of the monarch, Labramon jumps infront of of his master to protect her from the Yaksamon. The latter, then looks at the girl and jumps up, disappearing and returning to the shadows. This time however, not only they could hear the digimon running on the ceiling, but also, as they diverted their attention from the assassin, they saw a group of dracumons stealing the treasure chests behind the grave. Suddenly, Bishopchessmon opened the door to the garden, yelling for the king, only to see the monarchs body fading out from existence.

> Don't worry your Grace, we will get rid of these cri... Oh lord... What happened

Io was stunned on the ground, while Labramon answered

> Lord Bishopchessmon, quickly get those dracumons!! They are stealing from the treasury! I'll go after the Yaksamon who slayed the king and...

> NO!!! I mean, boy where did this person go? I know the castle better, you two must go after these thiefs I'll handle the assassin.

> Yes m'lord, understood!... Master, we must get going... Master?! Io! LET'S GO!!

Io snapped back to reality as Labramon shouted and immediately got up to follow him through the hallways. Before they could get out of the garden, Bishopchessmon warned them that they could use one of the carriages on the patio if they needed to go fast into the city.
The pair ran through hallways, trying to catch up with the thiefs. Some coins were falling on the ground while they jumped from wall to wall getting further and further away.

> Labramon, I think we gonna have to use the carriages to get ahead of them, they seem to be going back to the city, since there is no other way from here.

Labramon nodded and Io jumped on his back. She didn't know if that would work, but he easily managed to carry her weight. By taking a detour and going straight to the entrance. There, many pawnchessmons were on guard, looking up in hopes to spot the dracumons. Everyone was on edge.

> Hey, the carriages, we need to go faster to the city are any ready?

> Y-y-yes m'am. Guuuys, let's get the horses going!!

Io and Labramon jumped inside the carriage, the pawnchessmons also got in to drive it and they all rode as fast as they could to the city. While crossing the bridge Labramon noticed the dracumons crossing through as well, but closer to the water further out the castle. When warning everyone about it, they turned the chariot left, in order to try and cut them off. After a couple of minutes, they noticed their enemies jumping from roof to roof. Io looked at Labramon, who noded at her and they both stormed off the carriage, leaving the pawnchessmons there and started running.

> Labramon, how high can you jump?

> I can easily reach the roof of one of those houses master, but not the appartments... But... You can surerly ride me to the top.

> I don't think I can jump from one house to another as you chase them through the roof. I'd only slow you down. I'm gonna stay in these alleys.

While running, one of the dracumons crossed paths with them through the roof.

> Quick, Labramon, jump now, we can get one!

Labramon obeyed and immediatly attacked the dracumon with Retribark while they were jumping, which caused the imp to be knocked off the air and hit the alley's floor. A couple of seconds later, Io tackles the dracumon, stealing back the bag they were carrying.
Suddenly, a pawnchessmon appeared from that alleyway.

> Ms. Chosen One, may I have that one? The carriage is trying to keep up so don't worry about leaving these as you go, we can retrieve them.

It didn't go through Io's head how suspicious that looked, she was concentrated in enacting her plan alongside Labramon and simply complied to the little soldier and started running again.

> Labramon, how are things up there?

>Master, I can see both of them from here, but they are still a bit far, trying going to your left, let's meet a few blocks from here!

Labramon jumps from one roof to another and Io takes a left, still running and trying to find some stairs to climb or other ways to get on top of the houses. In the end, she finds a flight of stairs going up the city and uses it to carefully jump on top of a house below. It took her some time to maintain balance on that place, but after that she immediatly started to run again as she was hearing sounds of conflict nearby. By exhausting herself while trying to get from top to top of each house, Io finally managed to get a clear view of what was happening: Labramon was fighting for his life against the three remaining dracumons.
Io was tired, but she managed to get to the edge of the roof top, only to just be able to scream:

> Labramon, get out of there! NOOOOOOOOOOO!

Io had only met labramon a couple of days earlier, but they both knew that their emotional bond was strong, he could feel her sense of justice and she could feel his honest heart. As as her cries of despair turned into cries of hatred, what used to be her cellphone, now turned into a digivice, shone inside her jacket's pocket. A light so bright it created a flash, which after its effects left Labramon, now transformed into Dobermon.
In his new form, Dobermon didn't talk and his actions were swift. He seemed extremelly focused on completely obliterating the dracumons.

> Labr... Labramon?

Dobermon turned his head to her and jumped in her direction. Io tried to flee, but stopped at the edge of that rooftop. Dobermon was growling, but he didn't say anything, even as she begged to know what was wrong. Io was still crying as her partner menacingly approached and toppled her almost making her fall off. 
But at that moment, Io's emotions changed, she couldn't simply die before inheriting one of the biggest enterprises in the UK. Even less to someone who swore his loyalty to her. And so, her anger overcame the bites, scratches and blood to make her digivice shine again as Io punched Dobermon on the face. That act seemed to have brought not only sense into Dobermons head, but also his new form.
What were bites, turned into licks as the ginganticaly newly transformed Cerberumon regained his consciousness as a faithfull servant of Io.

>M-master, I'm sorry, it wasn't my intentions, master please forgive me.

The bond Io and Cerberumon could feel before was restored. The giant dog helped his partner to get up. Io was still angry at what those she judged to be thieving townsfolk, not generalizing all of them, but finally buying into the words from Bishopchessmon.

> How do I call you now?

> Cerberumon, master.

Io put her hand on Cerberumon's head, caressing him and saying

> Let's go back Cerberumon, we need to start changing this place... Bishopchessmon was right, we need to help them. The people, we need to root out the bad ones so they we can finally have some peace.

And while the girl hopped on top of her massive partner to go back to the castle, trying to fix what she thought to be an enormous problem, Bishopchessmon's carriage could be seem nearby, where pawnchessmons were gathering goldbags and gently tapping the back of a disgruntled dracumon in chains.
