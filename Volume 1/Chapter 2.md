# Legacy of Pain:

> Hey Luca, wake up!

Said Gladimon as he kneeled to help his partner, Luca. Gladimon was worried she had hurt herself after the explosion, more worried about her than the fact that they were both in another place completely different from the research center.

> Err, hmm, thanks Gladimon I don't… I just don't know what happened exactly.

With her partner's help, Luca finally gets up and looks around to try as grasp what was going on at that moment.

> It seems that we have been… Teleported? To another place in the Digiworld?

> It seems so M'lady, we should contact the base immediately.

Luca didn't answer, but she had a backpack together with her uniform and by taking it off to search for some gadgets, she said:

> Uh oh, Gladimon…

>Er... Yes, M'lady?

> Bad news and worse news. Our walkies and the comms device are completely broken and...

She shakes a small black screened rectangular plastic device and continues

> Damn it! The tracker is completely black, but… It's not broken? I dunno, this damn thingy.

Luca stores the gadgets back, frustrated and Gladimon puts his hand on her shoulder. 

> *sigh* Ok Gladimon, we need to start with some reconnaissance. Let's find a high place so we can see if we can find a town, a city, or something like that to situate ourselves.

> Surely M'lady, hop on my back'n I shall carry us to higher ground!

And with that, they both started to run around the forest, not only searching for a place to go, but also realizing they were many, many kilometers away from their base, which was, in part important, but not immediately alarming, as Luca was trained to survive in the wild since she was 4 years old, specially alongside Gladimon.

***

Only on the second day, they managed to climb further enough up the mountain to reach a point in the forest where they could see far and wide beyond. They couldn't see the sea yet, but down the mountain they could see a river passing by and way farther on, a desert.

> Well, that is it gladimon, we gotta go down this mountain and follow the river, we definitely are going to find some town built near it and on the way we may even find someone to ask about some directions or something.

> Yes Ma'am, sounds terrific to me!

One more day passed as they traversed through the forest, before they both noticed a village of goblimon nearby. They knew that usually, those digimon, could attack in group and were known to ambush those who they deemed enemies. Then, they cautiously approached the village walls, but their presence was duly noticed:

>*HUFH* What are you doing sneaking into my village?

A deep a growly voice spoke from behind them. A tall Ogremon was standing menacingly waiting for their careful response, ready to attack. Gladimon quickly put himself in front of Luca, and she answered before the situation could escalate:

> Wait, wai' wai' wai' wait... We mean no harm, we are lost traveling companions who only wish to find a nearby town, city, or place we can get information. I'm sorry if we seemed weird miss, but we truly mean no harm.

Luca kneeled down and signalized Gladimon, who did the same.

> *HUF* Then why doesn't it seem that I can trust you? Travelers lost HERE? There is something wrong with that.

> Yes, it is weird, and we are not from this place, we have been traveling for days in this forest, and we believe we've been instantaneously displaced from our research base from witithin the digital world. Teleported even...

The Ogremon rested her club on her shoulders

> Hmmm, you know what, kids do get spawned in the digital world from time to time, so perhaps your story makes sense. But then, you show up here sneaking around, wearing that uniform... *tsc*, how I am supposed to trust you??

> Well we've been living in the digiworld for a long time actually, but then we were suddenly teleported here while... In our building.

> Oh really? Then show me something that proves it! What is even the name of your organization?

Luca was surprised about how knowledgeable was Ogremon, looked at Luca's backpack, the girl understood it immediately and removed the item, unzipping it and showing its contents.

> We have a communications and tracking devices;  we have rations; my Digivice; binoculars; spare clothes and that's it.

> A Digivice? What is that?

> It's a token that...

>M'lady!...

>It's a token that represents the bond between me and Gladimon, it's very sentimental and useful for us.

>HMMMMMM, I see. Give me everything.

> What, but that's inconceivable!

Shouted Gladimon in protest to the demand

> Well, give me everything and IF after I give you the information, you actually leave, I'll have your rations and your device, which is very "sentimental and useful to you", delivered back to you, tomorrow.

Gladimon was still angry at the proposal, but as Luca touched his chest trying to calm him down, the knight stepped down and stopped protesting.

>  Ok, ok... If that is what it takes for you to trust us, sure. But if we don't get the promised things unscathed by tomorrow, we will have to come back looking for them.

> Sure *HUF*, no problem...

> Ok!

>OK!

> Sooo, about that information?

Luca gives Ogremon her backpack, a bit reluctant, but trustful in their abilities to get it back if anything went wrong.

> You were right, there is a city a day from here. They even have a factory there so they probably have something to help you effectively. We go there to sell things eventually. Follow the trail east from here and tomorrow night you will get there.

Luca and Gladimon thanked the rough Ogremon and decided to continue their path now they knew there was a city nearby. 
After it got dark, they managed to scavenge some meat apples nearby and make a small campfire before they went to sleep slightly off the road.

> M'lady, what is the plan in case they were lying to us?

> I think she wasn't lying, but she definitely knew something about the digivice. Maybe she wants to check with others in case we are evil or something and... Well, we know how to fight so we can get it back, we still have some cards in our sleeves if anything bad actually happens.

***

The beginning of the second day of travel was slow and full of uncertainties and Gladimon was still anxious about the deal. They both had already finished their first meal near the road and they were preparing to go back to the village, when they heard a distant "Heeeeeeeeey, lost travelers... Heeeey". It was a goblimon, running down the mountain on the road and they seemed eager, while waving their hand.
Both Gladimon and his partner stood there, waiting for the little guy to reach them, when the rest of the caravan, led by the Ogremon, could finally be seen coming down the mountain as well.

> Here is your screen device, lady... A-and the half rations too.

The goblimon unpacked what was in their bag and gave it to Luca, but he seemed nervous and a bit embarassed as well.

> I ended up eating a bit, sorry, I hope you don't mind... You both can just wait here if you want, we are going to the city sell some of the goods from the village.

Luca and Gladimon had finally realized what the Ogremon meant when they assured them that they would receive their stuff back again.

>Oh... Ooooh

And with that, the pair stood at the side of the road waiting for the caravan to pass by so they could also hop on. There was about people in 50 in total,  some of them driving crude mechanical makeshift wagons, including Ogremon, who stood in the front, leading the caravan. After, Gladimon and Luca got on the wagon with her, the girl asked:

> So, why did you need the digivice after all Mrs. Ogremon?

Ogremon was wearing a wide straw hat to protect from the sun and didn't really look at Luca while asnwering.

> Well, since we cleared y'all, I guess I can say it... Word is that there is a new Monarch in the kingdom north from here long further away than the desert. Usually, it doesn't matter y' see, but this time it's different. This time, it's not a chessmon person on the throne supposedly, it's a Human child with a very strong friend by their side... Soooo, I had to check if it wasn't you.

> err... "Human kid", but even so, IF that was true, how would you check using MY digivice?

>Heh, don't underestimate the elders in my village, they have a telephone line to the city and they confirmed the rumor, which means that if you are here with us *HUF* there are some other kid there. Also, the thingy you got there is different than the rumored one so, yeah, you get it.

>Different how?

Ogremon shrugs and doesn't answer. Luca understands that overstepping there could cause them to lose the village's hospitality and decides to just enjoy the ride.
It was around 17hrs when they finally reached the city, Luca and Gladimon had made good friends out of the village caravan, who ended up letting them stay with them at an Inn for the night. Ogremon bartered the backpack and the broken gadgets to pay for the extra room, which surprised the girl and her partner, for they were not expecting such foresight from her.
It was already night and Luca was too tired to go out and search for clues about the supposed child emperor so she decided to just take a bath and stay in bed trying to mess around her digivice in hopes to find something tha wasn't just Gladimon life status. Wisely, Gladimon also suggested they both stayed at the in and tried to rest for the next days could be crucial to gather info, but differently from Luca, he wnet for the balcony, where he spent a couple of hours just appreciating the nightime and the movement from the streets below.

***
The city was busy, crowded and full of workers. Luca and Gladimon had a rough start of the day as they bid farewell to the villagers and went into the city, now without much direction, since they didn't have any of the equipment left. The buildings were vast, a mix between victorian and mid 20st century architecture and a couple of european medieval houses inbwtween, which left our partners overwhelmed and confused on how was it all made and constructed with time.

> It's been almost a week Glads, everything we had was broken, no contact from the base, no teamates found. 

Luca was tapping her feet repeatedely.

> What will my mom say?... I don't like this at all, it feels like I'm failing agai-

> M'lady please! We are, in fact, making the best out of the worst situation possible. With, with your charisma and leadership were the PRIMRARY factors for us to get here and we haven'...

>Ok! ok, Glads ok, sure I get it, we just... have to keep moving.

Once again, Luca was trying to let go of her feelings, this time, bad ones, to focus on her task above everything else. Something she had to learn in order to meet the expectations of the NBR leader Auelya, her mother. Luca was aways expected to lead the team and spent many years learning how to do so, but now it was just her and Gladimon, alone. Her anxiety at the time wasn't really because she thought she was doing something wrong, but how would that be turned against her into a situation that was her fault. She commonly felt like that when things related to the team happened.

> Alright M'lady stop this right now. Let's breath a little right?

Gladimon put his hand on top of Luca's shoulder and they both began a series of breathing techniques they developed to try and distract her from those situtations in order for her to calm down a bit.
After while, Luca managed to refocus and devise their two top priorities: Learn more about the supposed kid Emperor and acquire resources to go to said empire and after that, they decided to search for a restaurant or one of the many foodstalls around the city so, maybe, they could get some money.
Even tough it took a while for them to find a place that would accept it, a Palmon fruit vendor was desperate for a shipment that never came and accepted to give them some food for the day if they managed to bring the shipment intact, which made the partners very happy, since their half rations should only be used in an emergency at that point.
Luca and Gladimon then, when to the northern outskirts of the city, where a lot of warehouses, Trucks and a trainline was located. Many people were carrying crates around and logging supplies, storing goods and such. It was equally as packed, noisy and disorganized as the center, but the duo managed to find the correct pick up in the end, when they talked to a small group of andromons who were organizing and storing crates in the biggest warehouse.

> Thankfully you came to us ms., we are going to have the order for Mr. Palmon at the ready. Sorry for the inconvenience, but this order number they gave you really helped.

> Yeah, surely, today is really packed right? There are so many people here.

>It sure is ma'am, but it's just another day here in Factory Town. But to be honest, these recent days the flow has been increasing. There is a rumor, though, that there is a new emperor for our region's Chess Empire there, so maybe that's why.

>Hmm, I see, do you know anything more about that? Seemed kinda of a sudden event right?

> It surely was ma'am, but unfortunately I have no extra input on that rumor. This week, huf! It has been rough.

A guardromon approaches the group with a crate in their hands.

> Here it is, order 547-GO-589 for Mr. Palmon. Since you are proxying for them, you MUST sign it here and here and also here.

> Er… Sure, I guess.

Luca signs the documents handed by the guardromon and tries to lift the box. However, it was too heavy for her, she practically couldn't move it. Promptly, Gladimon extended his arms and lifted it of the ground, helping his partner.

> Worry not, for I got it, M'lady.

> Thanks Glads. Let's go

The pair calmly walked back to the Palmon's stand, where they were met happily by its owner, who quickly revealed that the food crate was in fact, several bars of different metals. Luca was perplexed, but she quickly reminded herself that there are many digimon who eat those as well.  Finally, the owner gave them a bag full of different fruits, all them which both Gladimon and his partner could easily eat. A couple of day's worth of food secured, now they just needed a way to get to the chess empire past the desert.
They went back to the inn to properly eat and think about their next steps. Getting there, they noticed the caravan wasn't there anymore, most likely having moved to another city already during that morning. Luca and Gladimon sat at a table near the stairs to their room and eating, however, before they could even start discussing, the gargomon bartender got closer to the table and said

> Hey, hello, I noticed you guys brought your own food, but, I'know are you going to order something from here? I kinda need to to it to sit on our tables.

> Oh we are staying in this inn already no? we just wanted to sit for a bit and...

> Well, technically the caravan payed for your stay and it was only for one night anyway, sooo you guys are not our clients until you pay for the night or buy something to eat or drink.

Luca and Gladimon looked at each other with saddened faces, then Luca answered:

> O damn, really? Errr, ok, we don't have much money so I guess we will be going now hehe, thaaanks.

They had to go out of the establishment and they were a bit tired while walkign around the city, but at some point during the afternoon, Luca had an idea.

> Glads, listen up: What if we went back to those loading docks and tried to find some work there? They seemed to need a lot of help and maybe we can even get to know more about the supplies going to the kingdom.

> Indeed it seems like it could work! I could deploy my impressive muscular capabilities while you M'lady, can use your unparalleled leadership skills to organize their workforce into a perfectly oiled machine and...

> Ok ok, so you also think it's a nice idea too, nice. Then, let's go there.

Luckly for them both, when arriving at the trainstation again, they managed to easily find the andromon who helped them earlier. Luca told them that they needed a place to stay while in Factory Town and that they could help in return just for that. Andromon, pinched up on workers those days, accepted the proposal, specially since the kid only asked for lodging.

> And if yo uactually make a difference tomorrow I may even pay you a couple of bucks.

Luca was excited, especially because he let them stay inside the office room which had a bedroom in the back. Apparently they didn't use that room much because the workload was too heavy to have Andromon do officework instead of being hands on all day.
That night, Gladimon noticed that Luca seemed a bit sad, he thought it was related to the prospect of being able to see their friends again or not.

> M'lady, who do you think it's running the Chess Kingdom?

> What? Glads, I don't think tha-...

> Kai could make a great king certainly, no?

> Wha?!?! K-Kai? No way!

>Oooh

Luca's face got red.

> I mea-I mean, y'know right? I mean, that's not... UUGH! What I meant was: IF it was either Kai or Zhi they wouldn't want to become monarchs right away right? Assuming that each of us got separated, they would rush to find each other before everything else.

> Oooh, I see, so who do you think is running the Chess Kingdom M'lady? That only leaves us with Ovie or Jonah.

> I bet Ovie would make a really good king, maybe.

Gladimon began to retouch Luca's hair when she asked him for them to do another approach as they didn't know how much time they would spend away fromt he lab and a simpler approach to the locs would be better for now. They spent an hour or so talking with each other before going to sleep.
The second day in Factory Town began and the pair was early up to help the workers. Gladimon helped by carrying boxes and other tuypes of cargo, while Luca helped Andromon to optimize delivery routes.

> Well, I'll be damned kid, you helped us a lot today, deliveries are flowing! Here, go buy a decent meal for you two. 

Andromon gave Luca a couple hundred bits and sent them off while the morning shift was ending. Her and her partner went back to the Inn they stayed the other day and managed to order a nice lunch: one of those premade meals they make regularly with rice, beans, meat and salad on the side. They were hungry for a good balanced meal, since they've been eating only fruits from the wilds or handouts from the foodstall.
After lunch was done, they thanked the Gargomon and went back to work, however, as Luca left the establishment, she froze almost immediatly. The girl was looking at something that made her mind race so fast she couldn't even manage to keep holding the backpack with the fruits, dropping it on the ground. Thankfully, Gladimon was agile enough to catch it before any of the fruits got damaged, but his partner was just standing there, staring at another human child. A person who looked like to be a girl roughly Luca's age, happily looking at other stalls and stores along the street. A girl, who wasn't even remotely known to her, a girl not from the NBR.
