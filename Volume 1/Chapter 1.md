# What You Do to Survive:

A desert is definitely not the most optimal place to find yourself lost or even suddenly teleported to. Unfortunately, that is where Fritz woke up right after an abrupt flash of light while he was walking home. The boy simply found himself in a desert, the sun shinning bright on his head and the only other thing that teleported with him, was his phone. However, after feeling an unfamiliar touch in his hand, he noticed that the device had turned into something else. Now, it looked like some kind of outdated toy, still resembling a smartphone but bulkier and with a rubber casing.
The boy was perplexed, infatuated by the fact that he was now surrounded by heat and sweat, in a type of place where he never thought he would be. “Where is this?” He pondered as he skimmed his surroundings, but the only familiar characteristics he could find were random electric grid poles scattered around dunes and a varied amount of sand hills. Besides that and the excruciating heat, Fritz’s thoughts were suddenly interrupted as he abruptly got toppled.
With his back against the sand, Fritz could only see what he would weirdly be able to recognize as a Black Agumon. “Wait, what?” he thought as he tried to grasp this fantasy made reality.

> E… Excuse me, could you get off of me? I think I’m starting to fry down here!!…

> And why would I? I dunno you and no way I should trust someone who JUST APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE!

> Hmmm… I’m Fredrick, usually people call me Fritz, I guess. Could you please get off of me?

> Ok mister, unfortunately we’re not friends soo…   

Fritz was annoyed by the childish way in which that agumon spoke, but he could somehow empathize with the situation. So, by trying to think a bit more about  what he could do without escalating the situation, he said:

> Wait, wait! I have food!... No, sorry I actually don’t have food, but I can surely help you get out of this desert right? Better than trying to do it alone… 

> I guess… 

> Yeah, right? 

Both of them then distanced themselves from one another. She was looking at him with her eyes squinted in suspicion, however when they start talking again:

> Err. So like, you are an agumon right, just like the game?

> Well yeah, my NAME is Agumon, you almost said it right, but I'm from no game.

Agumon then suddenly jumps on him again grabbing his collar:

> Why? Why do I feel like I trust you? That is soooo suspicious!!

> Hey hey, I feel like I can trust you too! Right? I mean, you know, we could probably even get out of this desert together right? You know the place, correct? And… What are you even doing in the middle of the desert anyway?

> What are YOU doing here? Very, very suspicious.

>I... Hm, I was playing this game on my phone while I was walking home, then suddenly I got teleported I think? To here, wherever this is.

> Er, well. I guess you could say I know how to get out, but it's going to take like 2 days until we reach the forest again, and I DON'T wanna go back there.

Agumon crosses her arms and tries not to look Fritz in the eyes.

> 2 Days huh?... I guess that if you help me get out of the desert and into some civilization so i can use my phone, I can defiantly try to help with the forest.

> The forest is not the problem. It's my family, ugh… I live in a town y'know

> oh

Agumon, then starts walking away, with her hands behind her head, very casually as if she is already expecting him to follow. Fritz hesitates for a second, but promptly stars walking as well. As they are walking, he puts of the hood from his hoodie in an attempt to protect himself from the sun and then takes another look at his now changed phone “what is this thing?” he ponders as he looks at the device which now portrays a pixel photo of his new friend, Agumon.

After a couple of hours walking in the sun, the sounds of Agumon's growling stomach and Fritz panting from being tired could be heard from the area around as they were starting to slow down in their walk.

> Hey, I'm… Very tired… Could we stop for a while? This heat is insane… Ugh… I think I have an idea.

Agumon turns around and is met by the boy starting to dig the sand around trying to make a hole next to a tilted telephone cabin. She is perplexed, but as a shadow forms on the ground, she realizes what he is trying to do and helps. Thankfully, with her big clawy hands, they manage to make a sizable hole and get inside it, protecting themselves from the sun rays for a while. 
As the pair started to cool down and rest, Fritz noticed that Agumon looked sad. She was sitting in the corner, looking at the ground. He could simply feel she wasn't alright and right as he tried to reach her to ask what was wrong, Agumon burst into tears and hugged Fritz:

> Why?!!!? Why do I always have to do what they say?! I don't like working in the factory! I don't like having to spend my whole time helping the city! Not only that, but I just wanna be able to live on my own way. buaaaaaaaaaaaaa

> Er I mean, if you are here with me, it means you are on your own adventure right?

> Yeah dummie, but we are going back! You said you wanted to go there, and I ended up saying yes, so now we are going back.

Fritz started to caress Agumon's head in an attempt to calm her down a bit as he said:

> Ok, then we don't have to go to YOUR town, we just need to get somewhere we can eat and find out how to help me right?

> Ok I guess...

After saying it, Agumon tucked herself inside his hoodie, leaving only her head out and fell asleep right there. Fritz was tired as well and seeing that his new friend wouldn't be moving out of there so soon and the sun was still hot up in the sky, he decided to take a nap too "maybe it will make me less hungry" he thought as he closed his eyes.

***

It was around 17:00 when they woke up again as it was shown in Fritz phone device. They were both calmer and rested when Agumon suggested they continued to go forward until they found a usable telephone pole to break and use as a campfire at night, as it was, it is commonly known for deserts to be cold at night.
They both felt uneasy as they were walking through the night while still carrying all that wood. It suddenly came to them that they could've done something different during that afternoon to advance more instead. Both could feel that someone was following them. It was a weirdly nauseating feeling they felt in their gut. Fritz then whispered to Agumon that they should search for a good pole to make a campfire and pretend they were asleep to catch those stalkers. Since they were a bit tired, if they didn't catch anyone, at least they would end up sleeping. That seemed like a good idea at the time, but what they didn't know that the most common ability for gazimon to use is their paralyzing breath and a trio of them approached the campfire while stealthily wearing hoods.
Fortunately, when the first one was about to unleash his attack, Fritz shouted ordering Agumon to attack, since he knew she could spit out flames from when she lit up the fire.

>GWAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!

Shouted the three gazimon as they were not expecting to be counter ambushed.
Two of them managed to run immediately, but one, which got their face lit up in flames, couldn't escape. Fritz then, proceeded to tackle the digimon, holding them in place, while agumon used some loose cables from the telephone pole to wrap the remanding gazimon.

> Ok buddy, we have been walking the whole day, and you were even following us, now tell me, were is the food you gonna give us?

Fritz was tired, but managed to still look menacing while saying it, however, the gazimon didn't seem to budge.

> Lookie here “buddy”, YOU are the food! And it's just a matter of time for my siblings to come back after regrouping…

> He's right

Said Agumon, while behind her enemy.

> If he doesn't have any food… I guess we have to treat him like he would treat us!

>Wait, Agumon, we can't just kill them like that!

> Well, you haven't eaten, I haven't eaten and if we eat him, we definitely scare his siblings for good.

Now Gazimon seemed distressed.

> He-Hey buddies let's not resort to that, we... We actually have food you see, we could-we could share right, right. Just let my siblings get back and we will help, yeees.

Fritz and Agumon looked at each other in disgust, for they knew the rabbit digimon was lying.

> I don't know how they do things wherever you are from Fredrick Fritz...

>Hmmmmm

>But, here in the digiworld when we consume other digimon we get stronger and fed. If we are to survive this night with two more of these guys, we gotta do it.

Fritz was reluctant, but answered:

> Ugh... How do I do it then?

> Bite him, eat him!

> * *Gulp* *

It was late at night, they were walking for a total of over 6 hours in the desert, no food, no water, but Fritz wasn't that desperate, not yet. He was bruised, tired, dehydrated, but could still restrain himself from that.

> No agumon, I mean, we can't just kill that guy right now right? Let's just make traps or something. To guarantee that when they come for him, we still have an advantage and can just run?

> I hate this idea... We're exhausted you know, we just fought them! AAARGH, AAAA, fine. But I don't know how to make traps or stuff...

> I... I'm sorry Agumon, it's just that we must have other options yet... We just have to have other options still, We...

> Fine, fine, let's grab what's left from that wooden pole and dig a ditch around him them.

And as they both used what they could to dig through the night, making a huge hole around the tied up gazimon who spent most of the time laughing and telling them it was in vain, they started to get extremely tired. After the bunny digimon could no longer see what was above him, agumon whispered:

> Ok, so what we do now?

> We either start running now so they have to deal with him first or we hide an...

Without being able to finish his sentence, Fritz was interrupted by a scream. Something more of a war cry as the two remaining gazimon jumped from within two sand dunes nearby, attacking. They were both tired, but they were also holding weapons. Fritz tried to strike as soon as he could, but the gazimon's claws partially pierced the piece of wood and using the movement of their body, they disarmed the boy. Finally, by tackling that gazimon while they were trying to get the wood of their claws, Fritz got them to the ground and started punching.
Agumon, was having a different fight, a more agile one as she was trying to dodge the paralyzing  and electric breath attacks from the gazimon. As time passed, she was getting slower and she decided to use her Baby Flame to counter the attacks. A small explosion occurred when both abilities clashed, sending their casters to opposite sides. Agumon, immediately looked at Fritz to know how he was going, only to find her partner, beaten, bleeding with a head injury as he was now pinned to the ground as the gazimon laughed at him.
Quickly and without thinking much, Agumon ran and headbutted that gazimon while saying "Help Me!!", throwing them off guard and releasing Fritz. Luckily, the remaining one was still a bit dizzy and acted too late to realize their sibling was being thrown at them. The fight was over, with the only one gazimon still awake being that which was screaming and shouting for their siblings to untie them immediately.
Fritz was not well, he had been hit by the stuck piece of wood in the gazimon's claws and was bleeding from the left side of his head, enough to make him unable to open his left eye much. They stood there silent for a moment, tired, without knowing what to do exactly. But Agumon was keen:

> Fringe, my boy, we gotta do it. I gotta do it.

> It's Fritz...

> Bro, they are going to wake up

>Let's tie them then...

> We gotta shut up the awaken one. I'm tired, I'm hungry, you are bleeding, we GOTTA absorb their data I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN.

>HMMM

Fritz was desperate, he couldn't think well, but he split the rest of the improvised club into a kind of stake and went down the hole. His eyes were lightless, and he started to cry as the Gazimon begged for him to stop. Agumon had to hold the other digimon as they almost managed to untie themselves and with a swift stab on the throat, the boy managed to pierce their flesh while his partner bit them. However, as the gazimon died, his body started to turn into data, which Agumon could absorb, but Fritz, he could only watch as the essence fled completely from that body and turned into nothing.

> Agumon, did... Did you get it, did you absorb the data?....

> No but, I can get it, I mean it, I... I'm just tired, maybe with the others it wil...

> The others, you want me to do it again?

Neither of them were proud of what had just happened, but if Fritz had ever been hopeful until that moment, he was not anymore, he was looking at Agumon menacingly as he asked, but without her even answering, he started to climb the edge of the sand hole in order to get to the rest of the gazimon, now knocked out. Agumon, blabbered trying to reason, but he was determined. Fritz hurt his hands trying, but managed to get out of the hole and stay next to one of them. He was more desperate than he seemed and that became clear when Fritz jumped on top of one of the sleeping gazimon. It almost woke him, almost, if it weren't for the stabbings in the neck and bites from the boy, that gazimon would've definitely screamed. Agumon ran as fas as she could to get to them before the data was gone, but she couldn't absorb much, that one was gone. 

> I stab and you finish... Or else it doesn't seem to work...

>...

Finally, after getting that specific order right, Agumon could feel refreshed, as if she was powered up, but fritz was devastated. She tried to say something, but the boy immediately started to walk aimlessly. It took a while for her to think, but she grabbed his hand, began to guide him and, for her surprise, he simply followed. She could see Fritz had somewhat given up, he was walking automatically and wasn't even responding. After a wile, the only thing he could do was fall, kneeling first and then collapsing on the sand. His friend couldn't wake him up at that moment, she herself, was feeling desperate. She started to cry, but for some reason, she couldn't give up, differently from what she felt was happening that whole time, she couldn't give up. Agumon was dragging Fritz through the desert while crying, but she couldn't give up. Her hands hurt, and she could see he was still bleeding, but she couldn't give up. And that sliver of hope ignited in her an unprecedented resolve. Agumon was angry, she was determined to get Frtiz back to the forest and as soon as she realized it herself a light came from Fritz' pocket. The digivice, now shining, indicated what we all knew would happen, an evolution.
With a lonely roar in the night, Agumon emerged, now as Black Greymon, with their dark blue skin, black helmet and stripes and she knew what she had to do: carry her friend back to the forest and try to reach the city.
The problem there was the digimon wasn't able to locate herself well at night in the desert. Black Greymon wandered without knowing where she was going until a dim light caught her attention, it seemed to be a caravan of some sorts. Without thinking much, she ran in their direction but, unfortunately, she ended up fainting as soon as she reached the residents.

***

When Fritz woke up, he was in a bed inside a tent, Agumon was sleeping beside him while sitting on a chair.

> Agumon? Agumon?

Fritz was still a bit dizzy despite just waking up, perhaps from hunger. He was lookig at his friend, but was not able to get up immediately. Thankfully, however, agumon woke quickly after being called.

> H-hey there sleepy head, don't get up yet, Silphymon said to wait a bit for him to get back. Meanwhile though, they said to give you these when you wake.

Agumon reached out for a plate with melons and a small bottle of water and Fritz adjusted his body on the bed to start eating them. His eyes were baggy and he clearly still seemed tired, but started to ask some questions right away.

> Who's Silphymon? Where are we? Will they help ups get to the forest?

> Weell, it seems they are desert nomads who are crossing here... I guess. They didn't say much, but I was also a bit desperate.

> It's ok, hey, come here and get some melons too.

Agumon and Fritz stayed there for a couple of minutes, just eating and not saying much. Both of them were trying to rest somehow and simply appreciate each others company. The near death experience ended up bringing them together after all.
It didn't take long for the bespoke Silphymon to enter the tent accompanied by a Kazemon, they were both wearing turbans and tunics, probably to adapt better to the desert environment.

> Yo, Hey! You are awake finally. I hear your name is Fritz is that it?

> Y-Yeah

Kazemon pulls Fritz' digivice from her tunic and says:

> So you are carrying one of these huh? There are old stories of children with the power to manifest digivices.

> You guys know about these? Can you help me get back home and Agumon back to the forest?

> Well, we know OF these, our community studies old lore of this world. However, we know  that in the old stories, people designated as digidestined are supposed to follow their own path... Oh and sorry, we don't know how to go to the human world, but we surely can take both of you to the edge of the forest, since going further would delay us too much.

Agumon was nervous with that conversation, not because it seemed that Fritz was destined to a great future or something like that, but because she still didn't want to go back home.

> The edge of the forest is fine! We can go from there!

Silphymon and Kazemon glimpsed at each other for a moment.

> To be honest, kids, since Fritz is not so well yet, you both should stay here for today and we leave tomorrow morning. Doing it so, it will give time for you to eat well and rest, then tomorrow, I fly you guys there.

There was no objection there. Fritz and Agumons spent the day walking around the tents and occasionally sitting down to rest. They saw many other Silphymons and Kazemons as well as bokomons and a huge Blimpmon who was sleeping. They all seemed to travel with lots of books, drawings, laptops and even whole server set-ups inside the tents.
On the dawn of the next day, Fritz woke up well. His headache was gone, but he could still feel the bump on his forehead. After waiting for Silphymon to pack a couple of supplies in a backpack and wear a weird bag holster and removing his tunic, he told them:

> 'Aight kids, hop on and hold on tight, we up for a good time.

Fritz and Agumon hesitated a bit, but followed their instructions. Soon, Silphymon showed what he excelled at: he took a breath and started running; then, after dozens of meters, he prepared and jumped. The kids weren't prepared and screamed a bit, meanwhile already knowing about the surprise, Silphymon was laughing.

> Hold on kids, you are going to be amazed soon!

They were too fast for either of them to answer, but indeed they were amazed when reaching peak height for that jump. The forest could be seen on the horizon, still very far away, but the scenery was amazing: The desert wasn't uniform at all, many places had small biomes even if the telephone poles and booths were pretty much prevalent throughout.
Silphymon then, started to glide, extending the beautiful experience for everyone, but after about an hour gliding down, he smirked:

> You guys ready for another jump?

And then the process began all over again. This time, however, after a while gliding down, they were shot out of the sky. Silphymon's arm was bleeding and they were falling fast, but thankfully, he managed to regain his footing and dive down to save the kids. Even so, after grabbing them with his feet, he quickly let them go to dodge another shot and this time, they could all notice an enormous cargodramon closing in.
Silphymon decided that the kids would be able to survive the fall and dove down to run, as he was faster that way, in order to try and divert attention. Ultimately, it worked, the Cargodramon followed him while Fritz and Agumon survived the fall. The boy didn't survive as well as the digimon, as they were falling, Fritz held Agumon as strong as he could and when they hit the ground, he broke his arm on impact and while the adrenaline was still pumping he waited for Agumon to get up and ran to the direction of the forest as if there were no tomorrow.

> Agumon! Let's go, Fast! We need to go before they notice us.

She was concerned about her partners health, but she knew he was right at tha point, so both of them headed for the forest.
