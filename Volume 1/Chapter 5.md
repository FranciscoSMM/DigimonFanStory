# In Solitude, we Do Better:

The gentle sound of waves crashing on the rocks woke Hiori up. His head was a bit dizzy, but he managed to stand up and balance himself on a balcony railing. It took him a couple of seconds to grasp where he was, but, adjusting his glasses he could see the environment around him: Several towers, each relatively close to each other, but separated by sea, with only a couple of bridges linking them together. Those green stoned structures were tall and had weird rightings on their sides. Many had external balconies and stairs as well. Far away in the distance, Hiori could see land, but definetly close enough for a simple swim.

> Damn, where am I?

The boy said as he started to move, only to be abruptly stopped as his foot stumbled on a strangely familiar rectangluar piece of metal. "Wait is this a?..." Hiori couldn't even finish his thought as he reached down to immediatly open what he judged to be a laptop. To Hioris surprise, he was right, however, after booting up the machine, he simply couldn't understand any of the characters appearing on it. "did it really work? ugh..."
Hiori closed the laptop and began to carry it as he explored the space around him. After entering the first door he found, which was right next to the balcony, the boy discovered that the laptop wasn't really a special device in that place. Inside the room, there were several damaged ones just like the model Hiori picked up, they were pilled and scattered across the room and some even had their screens on. "What is this place?" thought the boy as he picked up some of those brick-like laptops, in hopes one of them could lead to a better understanding of what was going on.
After a couple of minutes scavenging through the piles of tech, he decided that the first one was in better conditions and left the room, walking back through the balcony and down the stairs around the spire.
Hiori now found himself looking at a suspended bridge and a door faraway right after it. But at the moment he thought about stepping onto that bridge, Hiori heard non-descriptive electronic noises on his left. The boy was especially at the possibility of finding other people in that place and following the noise, not only did he find another room on the side of the tower, but also someone was in there, searching through piles of junk, just like Hiori was moments ago.
Cautiously, the boy stood against the wall to spy on the person there, trying not to make any sound. Hiori was too concentrated in his action and didn't notice the approach of a monitamon, who was carrying a pile of junk. The digimon silently stepped back and, after a moment, came back with three more other monitamons. The space on that staircase quickly got overcrowded.

> Hey, who are you??!

Hiori screeched and jumped forward in surprise, which led him to almost fall off the staricase into the sea, if it wasnt' for the immediate collective reflexes, the boy would've died there. In the end, a chain of monitamons were holding hands as they held tightly to Hiori and after a couple of seconds, they managed to bring him back to the stairs.

> *panting* Oh man, I almost died... But... Tell me something, are you guys like... Monitamons?? What is going on here?

The group of digimons were still catching their breath when one of them answered:

> Are you crazy, boy?!?!!? Why did you just jump out like that?

> I-I was scared ok, you scared me calling me out like that.

It took a moment before Hiori could recompose himself after his near death experience and then, after arching and adjsusting his back, he continued:

> Ok, ok, but like, you guys are really small and have monitors on your faces. Not only that, but right before waking up here, I was playing a game that had you in it. So... Are you monitamons?

>... Obviously. But kid, why are you here? How did you even get to this place?

> I don't know, as I said, I was playing digimon on my PC and when I got up to get some water, I blinked and simply woke up here as if I'd just woke up from a long sleep.

>...... That makes no sense at all dude.

Hiori shrugged as he new what he said was true and he didn't have a clue on how to complement that information.

> Well, anyway guys, back to work, I'm gonna deal with this one. Better do it now, before our manager comes here to see what's going on.

The monitamons quickly scattered and the place was empty as if no one was ever there. Meanwhile, Hiori and the last remaning monitamon were now inside the room where the boy first heard the sounds. Inside, there were also many different broken devices, laptops, computers, hard drives and similars, but also two hagurumons sorting junk and processing data trough some cables.

> Ok mr., since I don't think you are going to be able to leave this place so soon, might as well put you up with the program here, so no one can contest you 'aight?

> Uh, ok, but what does that mean exactly?

> well...

Monitamon sat down and gestured Hiori to do the same, which he did.

> As you know, we, monitamons are very good at spotting things and also being very stealthy. My group was contracted to do an unusual job, a very long one, might I add. We are here, contracted by someone I just cannot tell you, please don't ask, to sort and find as much data as possible in these spires without it seeming that there are people here. That is why we work separatedly, at most transporting things from one room to another.
> We use these hagurumons here...

>Hi, thats us

> ...to store the info we find and at the end of each month we report back. So, let me be real here, it' snot at all common to have humans here, nonetheless ones that are just teleported to this place, even less a child like you, so, until I figure things out grab one of those hagurumons to accompany you during your stay here.

> Huh? What for?

>That is what I was getting at. With one of those you can get clearence to most of the areas, including the bathrooms and the dinning hall. But don't worry, your Hagurumon will guide you if needed, it's just that it would feel bad to leave you in this maze with nothing.

> Er, thanks, but like, how do I get out? And how do I get back to the Human World?

> To be honest, boy, I don't know and I can't care right now, I have this job to do, but now I guess you can just wander around, and and maybe you can even gather some info and have Hagurumon store it for you, y'know, help us out in the mean time. However, regarding getting out of here, at the end of the month, in roughly two weeks, we all go back to the city while they compile the data before we get back here again, so maybe in that time you can leave.

Monitamon rushed Hiori out the room and back into the flight of stairs leading to the bridge, in which the boy and his new companion started to walk or, inthe digimons case, float on. Hiori was still carrying the bricked laptop as if something was telling him to not let that go yet and, when noticing it, Hagurumon asked:

> Excuse me sir, but I have two questions...

>er, ok?

> First question: How should I call you sir? Second question: Why are you still carrying this malfunctioning device? Is it working perchance?

> Huh, yeah it's still working, but I don't know how to use it, the interface is all scrambled... Oh yeah, and yeah, my name is Hiori, you can call me that I guess.

Hagurumon flinched.

> Alright Mr. Hiori, why don't we cross that bridge and get to a room, maybe I can help you with the interface.

Hiori, nodded and followed the digimon across the bridge to another flight of stairs on the next spire. There, they found a similar room to those before, empty of people but full of junk. Hagurumon asked Hiori to put the laptop on the ground and turn it on. After doing so, Hiori complained about the symbols on the screen, to which his companion replied:

> Oh, would you prefer them in another language? I can chage it for you.

>Duh! Yes! Can you change to english? It would be easier for me to read it.

Hagurumon extended a couple of cables from his own body into the laptop hubs and closed his eyes for a moment. Then, the laptop screen  blackedout leaving only a loading bar in the center, in which after a while it finished, revealing a similiar interface but now entirely written in english.

> Yes, now we are talking, thank you Hagurumon!

> You are welcome, Mr. Hiori, I hope this will assist you in collecting new data.

Hiori's face got serious for a moment, once he realized that Hagurumon was actually reprogramed to believe he was a worker there and he didn't really what could happen it he failed. However, shortly after that, the boy began to focus on getting information from that computer. Lost in the moment, he searched for information about that world first, but that computer only contained datalogs of old researches and cleaning schedules for the spires. The texts were written in a very old way, fully of technical terms and logs with weird dates, making Hiori's energy start to dwindle as he skimmed through the files and folders.
Meanwhile, Hagurumon was searching the junk, not for more laptops it seemed, but for a satchel. In the midst of those old computers, robes, shoes and satchels sized for the devices could also be found. Those seemed like remnants of other workers past, as they all looked similar, just like the laptops.

> Here it is Mr. Hiori, a fine satchel for your laptop. Iseems you found a good one in there.

Hiori was too concentrated to notice it immediatly, but as soon as he saw the bag right beside him, he replied:

> Oh, oh thanks, but this one is gonna be though tough. Without an internet of somesorts, searching for... these infos... Is gonna to be hard.

> Oh no, using the net to acquire or share information for this project is strictly forbidden. The data must be processed through us, Hagurumons every month and...

> I know, I know, but hear me out, what if I used my phone here which has access to another internet? I mean, I have this one thing here and... Huh??? this is not my phone???

Before being transported to that world, Hiori had just put his phone in his pocket. However, when taking it out to check if it could access any type of internet from inside the Digital World, he was perplexed to find that the device he thought to be the cellphone, was now this weird outdated toy, still resembling a smartphone but bulkier and with a rubber casing. The screen on the device was turned on and had a pixelated chibi version of a Bulucomon on it's center. The image was blinking on and off in a slow pattern and there was nothing else on the screen besides a pixelated background where a sunny beach could be seen.

> Oh no I know what this is... If I'm correct, Hagurumon, then I'm...

Hiori exitated in continuing his phrase, he thought that revelealing his thoughts about being a "digidestined" just like the game he plays in his phone, could trigger a negative reaction from hagurumon. He knew, from the story in that gacha phone game, that many powerful digimon were always trying to stop, kill, kidnap or even control those types of kids.

> Then I think I have to find this person here, you see?

> Hmmm, I see, maybe they wcould help set up your device?

> Maybe... But say, Hagurumon, could you help me set up this device here with the laptop, maybe I can use it to, y'know, extract the information from the device, maybe it's useful

> Oh, of course Mr., however, the time to eat dinner will soon come, I suggest we head to the main research tower so we are not late and then maybe tomorrow morning we can see to it in a better mood?

> Oh yeah, do I get to go to a dorm too or we all sleep in these rooms?

> Mr. Hiori, the main research tower has a dorm as well as the cantine as Mr. Monitamon said earlier. It will tame some time for us to get there, that is why I'm suggesting we go now.

> Sure, I guess.

Hiori and Hagurumon then left that room and the boy started to follow the digimon as they floated through bridges, staircases and hallways insithe the towers. After about forty minutes touring the spires, hiori could see a metallic structure to which most of the suspended bridges linked into. That metal tower didn't seem like the stone spires they spent all day in, it seemed like it was built there, much like an oil rig would be build on top of the sea.
When they got close enough, Hiori could see that many monitamons were gathering at the place. Many of them were entering the building, but some were messing around laptops, talking with each other or just chilling while leaning on the low walls. Besides them, there also some guardromons flying around and landing on higher levels of the tower as well as many Hagurumons standing by, close to other digimons. Finally, a few other random digimon also composed the crew , but were very few and scattered to present as a class such as the previously mentioned.
When entering the tower by that level, Hiori was met with a huge food court. Many digimon were just eating or getting to a table to eat. The movement was huge and Hagurumon quickly suggested Hiori to go grab a plate and them they would get a seat somewhere. To the boys surprise, no one seemed to care he was a human being. It seemed that, as long as Hagurumon was accompaning him, people just didn't bat an eye.
After a nice dinner composed of mostly of common seafood, Hagurumon took Hiori to the dorms, where they found a small bedroom to fit in. The rooms were actually well made capsule bedrooms, much like the overpriced hotels in the human world. Both the boy and his friend could fit in, but only while sitting down, however, that didn't prevent Hiori from pulling out his laptop and asking Hagurumon for help on connecting the phone to it.

***

Without much success on the first couple of days, Hiori didn't give up on trying to find as much as he could about the project he was teleported into and what happened to his phone. He was skeptical of Hagurumon, who seemed to only respond properly when promped with work related issues and after some time, on the third day, he decided to try something risky after the dinner that night.

> Hey, Hagurumon, you said you could be programed to follow certains things right? Would you like to be reprogramed to be, like, free? I mean that could help you out y'know.

> I'm sorry Mr. Hiori, but I do not follow? How would overwritting my settings for this job help me with it?

> Er, hmm... If you weren't tied to your program limitations you could, er... Make better decisions about what types of information could be useful or even help out more the moniatmons.

> Hmmm, what you are saying is that, instead of simply deleting my aforementioned system, we bypass the restrictions so I could better argue with my partners huh? It is risky, but I could also choose to withhold information to protect them better and not let them make mistakes. Technically that WOULD in fact decrease the number of errors and useless information we retain and send to processing...

> Y-yeah, thats right.

> I don't know Mr. Hiori, this could be a heavy burden upon you. If you...

> I can take it, I promise!

> Ok then, let's do it.

Hagurumon interfaced with the laptop and guided Hiori trough his own interface in order for the boy to be able to mess around the programing. Hiori was a quick learner and already knew a couple of human world programing, since he loved to make mods for his favorite videogames and that gave him an edge while working that night.
It was late at night when Hiori finished the job. He looked like as if a person was drained by a thousand leeches, sitting there shrivled. Hagurumon, on the other hand, was frozen in place, loading. Hiori didn't know that at the time, but incorrectly messing around a Hagurumon could simply break them completely into countless cogs and that lack of information definetly made him more confident while coding.

> Hiori! Hey, wake up! Hiori, we need to get out of this place, fast!

The boy was tired, but the sense of urgency overtook his body.

> What? What do you mean?

> This data gathering project is not safe for humans, even less humans that have a device like yours. The brigade oversees this project and it will not take lightly on the interference of people from the human world.

> The Brigade?

> Yes, you see, there is a corporation called the D-Brigade which is know to orchestrate military operations throughout the digital world. Many times, they also partnered with humans in different timelines and universes to solve problems with criminal digimons and such. The problem is that the brigade is now researching the events from a couple of centuries ago and they involve humans interfering with the Digital World somehow.

> So, if I'm still here by the time they come to collect data, I'm cooked? Uh oh. But how do we leave, where do I go?... Ok, I think I might have to open up a little here then. Do you know anything about digidestined?

Hagurumon stopped a bit.

> My personal experiences and my registries for this mission does not include information about such topic, sorry man.

> Well, I was playing this game before being teleported here where I was like a trainer and partnered with many digimon in fights, but in the story, each kid trainer had a special bond with a digimon through the digivice, so...

>So the Bulucomon on your "phone" are they the one you should be looking for?

> Huh? The-the one on my new phone? Wait, you might be onto something...

Hiori thought he'd created a bond with Hagurumon, he even thought that by digivolving, he could use his partner as an armor later on. Sadly, for him, he quickly realized that Hagurumon was probably right and the images on his phone meant something.

> Hagurumon, do you any way we can leave this place?

> Yes, when the managers come collect the data, they bring a Cargomon and put everyone inside, then we fly to an undisclosed inland facility where the researchers and hagurumons are separated for monthly debriefing.

> Err, hmmm so, no way of leaving these towers before that it seems. Hmmm, well, I guess the only option I can see now is getting to that Bulucomon, maybe they know a way out of here. Quick, Hagurumon, help me connect my phone to the laptop.

After plugging all the cables between Hagurumon, the laptop and the digivice, Hiori ended up finding out that the blinking bulucomon pixel art was part of a tracking app. As soon as a map opened up on the computer, Hiori felt the fatigue accumulating.

> Y'know what Hagurumon, I'm way too tired, I can't even process what is this map doing. I need to sleep.

> Surely Hiori, I'll update you tomorrow.

***

Hiori woke up with a slight headache, he didn't know what time of the day it was, only that he was hungry and couldn't see very well. So, after picking up his glasses, he realized that Hagurumon was at the edge of the bed, slurping on canned oil. Hagurumon had also brought a plate with toast, coffee, fried fish, papaya, banana and some salt crackers, a true and normal breakfast.
While approaching the food, Hiori scratched his eyes while saying

> Hey, good morning, thanks for the food, so we, like, eat and then start the search?

> Oh no, not reccomended. I would not advise staying in this cabin for too long after waking up, we should go to one of the rooms in the spires, believe it or not it's more isolated than here if something happens to us.

Without objection, Hiori grabbed the plate a followed Hagurumon. He was still skeptical if his atempt to rewrite his new friend had succeeded. As he walked and ate, the boy started to wonder if he was walking into a trap, but as he realized he was still tired psychologically, he could only think "it is what it is" and continued to follow. Soon after, they got to a room far south of the central spire. In there, Hiori connected the digivice to the laptop and finally accessed the map.

> Oh, look Hiori, the possition of the Bulucomon on the map has changed, they are actually closer than yesterday.

> What? You can tell? I don't even know where we are in this map.

Hagurumon started a lesson trying to explain to Hiori the basics of carthography, but the boy was still too tired and unfocused to pay attention.

> Ok, ok, Hagurumon, let's focus here, can you show me where I am in this map so I understand it better?

> Surely, just a second... Hmm... Hiori, I found something new here, maybe it helps.

While Hagurumon was connected to the computer,  7 red dots appeared on the map.

> Look, we are this dot here, but these other ones, they are other devices just like this one, maybe there are others like y...

The laptop was heating up fast. Steam started to come out, the screen glitched and 
sparks came out so quickly that made the laptops screen explode. Hagurumon barely had time to disconnect from it and it wasn't enough to shatter the digimon into a thousand gears, but enough for them to shutdown completely and fall to the ground. The digivice was launched from the cables onto the wall. Hiori only managed to react to his phone, as it took a bit for him to notice Hagurumon falling.
There wasn't much damage to the digivice, but when Hiori Turned around and saw Hagurumon, the boy rushed to aid his friend. Without any success by calling out his friend's name, Hiori tried to put him up in order to see if his insides could be rebooted, but before he could act, the boy heard a loud siren noise. "UH OH" thought the boy while trying to hang Hagurumon in his satchel. The digimon was heavy, but the boy managed to use that bag to hold him while running out of the room. At distance, he could see two guardromons flying to his direction.
