# Opening

All the main cast are seen without much context, each of them has either stopped doing something or was playing Digimon mobile game while doing something else. Hiori was usign his computer to play the game while his phone was on his pocket; Maki was helping her dad fix a car, when she stopped to play the game just for a bit; Fritz was going back home from school when he decided to play while walking; Io was skiing, when she decided to stop and take a breath just to play for a while and the last one to be shown is Luca, who seemed nervous and was standing behind a door before what seemed to be a meeting with the rest of the Research Team.

A huge flash of light is seen, every panel shows the kids being surprised by it and then, nothingâ€¦

The first volume is mostly composed of simultaneous chapters, which here means that the ones talking about each child's arrival on the digital world happens at the same time and so can be read in any order.
