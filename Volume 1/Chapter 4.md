# Happy Accidents:

Maki woke up while drowning. She couldn't aunderstand the place whe was suddenly at, except by the fact that she felt like she was being pulled somewhere inside a body of water. She was still floundering when she noticed there was a body pulling her in some direction. Finally, by the time Maki felt her life slipping away, both the entity and her flew out of the water, landing on grass by a tree.

> Hey Girl, are you alright? You didn't drown did'ya? Hey!

Maki managed to sit down and coughed up some watter. Then, panting, she answered:

> I'm fine now I guess, thanks. But, where am I right now?

> Oh, this is DataRiver_Green-3

> Er, Data Green... Is it really the name of this river?

> Well dur, of course, at leas that is how eveyone calls it.

>Who's everyone?

Maki was still trying to catch her breath as she asked, but was basically, immediatly answered when a school of other betamons emerged from the river.

> Hey Betamon, What you doin'?

> Hey guys, look! I found this human, she was like drowning drowning!

> Uh oh, here comes trouble bros, let's steer away from this one

Maki raised her hand waving "hi" to the other betamons and some of them waved back. She was still tired and Betamon could see it. So, he answered his friends:

> It's ok guys, y'all go ahead, I think today I'm gonna help this one out, it seems like it's going to be an adventure too!

>'Aight, suit yourself bro, see ya later!

"See y'all later" also said most of the other betamons while going back to the river.

> Alright, girl, what is your name again? Mine is Betamon by the way.

> Oh hi, Im Maki... So you are Betamon huh? I think I've read this name somewhere before. Is it like the other ones that were here?

> Kinda, mine is Betamon tho', the others have their own names.

> Oh I see.

They both stared akwardly at each other for a moment, before Betamon continued

> So like, how about I take you to Saboro and there you can get your clothes dry huh? Meanwhi..

Suddenly Maki raised her hand

> Excuse me! Wha-what is Saboro? Is it a place?

> Oh! Oh yeah you're not from this place, I forgot, my bad. Saboro Village is a place close from here, they are cool and welcoming townsfolk, I bet you can stay there for a while after too

> Hmm I kinda want to go home really...

> Huh? Where are you from, Maki?

> Me? I'm from Ibaraki... But if I understood it correctly, my city is not from this world I guess...

> Huh? Not from the Digiworld? Oh wait, that's right, humans are not from the Digiworld. That one I heard!... Say, let's go to Saboro Village anyway and meanwhile you tell me about you and the human world so I can also ask the people from the village if they know a way to get you there.

> Wow! That sounds awesome! Thanks Betamon, you are a real lifesaver!

Maki and Betamon strolled through the forest for about 2 hours before they reached the outskirts of Saboro Village. While doing so, they happily got to know each other. Maki told betamon about her family, how her father was a dutch boat mechanic who arrived in japan in the 80's and decided to stay there after meeting her mom, who, at the time was studying to go to a nursing school just after highschool. In turn, Betamon told her his days were very simple, that he and his friends had a regular routine of visiting different places daily, playing and talking to other digimons. He told her how he wanted to explore more, but felt like as long as he was with friends, life couldn't be so bad and that he was happy.
***
Saboro Village was a calm place, many different types of digimon flew, slithered and walked around, doing their daily chores among suspended houses on trees, wooden bridges and buildings near the river that crossed the vilalge itself. Maki was amazed at the verticality and quickly noticed that the riverline was a bit thin and her thoughts started to wander into how could that be. "Was it a broken dam?" "could it be that there is something wrong up the river?" "Maybe someone is using all the water" "the river has nice color though, I hope we get to  see more of it"
 "do they have regular fish in the digiworld?" "What if I made a..." 
 Maki's thoughts were interrupted suddenly as she now found herself in a huge room in the presence of a Babamon and a Cherrymon. Makis' head hurt slightly as she quickly realized it was because of the old woman's staff and Betamon seemed a bit worried, even though they were smilling a bit.
 
> Ouch! Sorry hehe, I'm Maki, pleased to get to know you.

She bowed in hopes to demonstrate respect and Cherrymon Sighted

> Well young lady at least you have some manners. But never zone out while your elders are speaking, you hear me?

The giant tree digimon wasn't angry, but expected more of the new person Betamon brought in and Maki was already used to being scolded by people for not paying attention sometimes.

> So agaaaain...

Said the Babamon

> What brings you here to our village, girl?

> Oh me? I wanna go home actually, I 

> What? Go home? No one is stopping little girl, if you wanna go you can literally just go!

Babamon started to get a bit angry

*Cof Cof* 
> Wait a bit dear, let's not get hasty, if the young lady here wants to go home, it maybe be because she can't somehow

> Oh... I guess you could be right, sorry. Go on girl, explain yourself.

>I mean, Well... I guess... I, hmmm... I'm from the human world, not the Digiworld. And I don't know how to get back...

Babamon and Cherrymon stared at each other for a while in doubt, but returned to the girl.

> Unfortunately, child, this answer we do not have. We could try to find you a place to stay here for a while, but we also don't know how much...

> What if I help out with the water?

Betamon was perplexed

> Huh? The water? What is wrong with the water? It tasted fine just earlier...

And then Babamon answered

>Well well, you have a fine eye, girl... Don't you remember Betamon, we are having problems with the water up river. Do you think you can help? How so? What I can say is, IF you can help, we definetly would have a place for you here in Saboro.

> Hehe, I guess it costs nothing to help. I think I'm going to have to learn more about here if I wanna go home after all.

***

Babamon took Maki and Betamon up the river while Cherrymon stayed at the village. The place had lushous flora, but also a wide almost dried river. In its center, everyone could se a yellowish Rock formation, with many spires through which water flowed. 

> Well, here is our problem, you see?

Maki held her hand on her chin

> I see, this rocks here are the problem, they are blocking the water!!... But they look so ancient, haven't they always been here?

> Of course not you Id... Ig-noble child. It's a damend Tortamon don't you understand?!?!?!

Betamon started to get concerned, for he new that Tortamon was not someone who would easily calm down if annoyed and the conversation was escalating a bit.

> Oh yeah grandma?? Then where is this guy? Is he hiding? I'm going to call him out!

> Oh suuure, girl, call them out see what's good for you!! You are going to learn some real harsh lessons today!...

Babamon was jumping furiously as she said that, but stopped once she realized that Maki was actually going to do and that she incentivised the girl to act in a way which would affect everyone... Negatively

> TORAMOOOOON!!! TORTAMOOON!!! WHERE ARE YOUUU COME HERE NOW! WE NEED TO TALK!

Betamon and Babamon were frozen in place. They knew.

> ...

The ground started to shake, everyone started to fumble on their feet and finally a sound. It started quietly and it exponentially grew in volume as the rock formation shook, elevating itself to reveal giant tortoise-like paws and a huge draconic head.

> whaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!

At the point in which Tortamon finally revealed themselves, all of our three friends were sitting on the ground, even Betamon.
Tortamon was staring directly to Maki, their face was extremelly close to hers as if expecting an answer from the girl. Maki on the other hand, was astounded, but quickly managed to get up on her feet again and stand before the gigantic turtle.

> A-are you Tortamon? Why are you just sitting here?

Betamon and Babamon looked at each other. The small reptile signaled the old lady to keep quiet.

>Me? What do you mean? This is my place! It's peaceful, quiet and the sound of water is very calming.

> But, but you didn't use to live here did you? 

>W-ell, no, but what is it to you? I'm not even doing anything! It took me so long to prepare this place for myself. Is that why you people are bothering me? I'm not gonna back out this time!

Tortamon started to move into a more offensive position, as to start firing the rock missiles from her back. Betamon and Babamon, got extremely scared and began to back away slowly, but Maki, she stayed there. Her face wasn't angry, but concerned, something in Tortamon's speach made her think.

> Wait a second, "back out THIS TIME"? Did something bad happened to you? Did someone hurt you?

Tortamon, who was getting angry, backed down as she saw Maki's eyes. She could see the child genuinely cared and that action actually descalated the situation. Tortamon was now in the verge of crying and Maki could definetly emphatize with them.

> YEEEEES, they DID!

Tortamon bursted into tears. Her cry was loud, almost like a screech and was so powerful that made some bird digimons fly away from nearby trees.

> I really don't like living near a lot of other tortamons, they do all their stuff, like community watcing of old shows and singing lessons. *sob* So I decided to live by myself  and it took soooooo much time to find a place near my family, where I could just live a cozy and simple life, feeling the ocean waves on my back... But one day, one day after I'd visited my family, I was happily strolling back home when there they weeere! A bunch of pirates had built port INSIDE my pond? Why? How? I don't know! I don CARE! I just want to have my home and stay theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerwuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

Tortamon was in shamble, she was crying her heart out in a cacophony that could be heard from over a kilometer away. Maki was also crying, even though her hands were being used to cover her ears. However, as she decided to run towards the giant turtle, she couldn't helo herslef but to uncover them and balance her body as she ran.

> I'AM GOING TO HELP YOUUUUUUUUUUU!

Tortamon suddenly stopped crying once she noticed that the girl was now hugging her.

> Y-Y-You are going to help me? Why? How? Why even care?...

> We-well, I wanted to help the people from the village, but your situation is so much worse. I think we can all help each other!

> Really????

Tortamon was surprised in a good way. She could really feel like Maki was telling the truth, that the girl really cared about her. Then, by caressing maki's head with her beak, Tortamon said:

> You are really going to help aren't you?

> I'll do my best to help you and the people of Saboro Village.

Tortamon looked at Babamon abrutly

> You are going to help too ain't you gandma?!?

Babamon and Betamon stared at each other again, but this time, Betamon simply smiled and took a stepback.

> Y-yeah sure I'll help the girl and you, sure.

Maki turned to Betamon with wide watery puppy eyes and finished

> Me and Betamon, right? We are going to deal with the pirates.

> Uuuuh, I mean...

He couldn't escape Maki's overwhelming charisma and also felt like he should do what he could to help eveyone.

> Fiiine, we could really die, but it's going to be an adventuuuure... I guess.

Maki and Tortamon smiled and the girl went to her fishy friend in order to hug him in appreciation for his help. And if there were any doubts in Betamons head about what he got himself into, hugging Maki definetly eliminated it.

> Ok Tortamon, you wait here while we go there and fight some pirates, yaaar

Babamon interruped Maki by choughing loudly

> You know ms. Tortamon, you know it will take some time for you to get there, so why don't you get a little bit ahead of yourself and start going back, so you can meet the kids when they are done there?

> Huh? I think that is actually a good idea grandma. I'm gonna be on my way.

Babamon gestured a hangloose and winked at Maki, who got confused at first but was quickly advised by Betamon to just accept it. The girl quickly understood why the old lady suggested that: The pacing from Tortamon was so slow and loud that by the time they got there, she probably would only by halfway at best.
***
So, after getting directions for the giant tortoise digimon, the pair followed a path through the forest to a vast cove with a narrow entry near the sea. Both the kids could see a tall wooden strutcture that encompassed the cove with a huge ship in it's center. That makeshift port was crowded with lots and lots of different digimons, from sangomon, syakmons and ganimons, to hookmons, mermaimons and a divemon, who seemed to be solely concerned with fixing something on the side of the boat.

> Look, Betamon, they are hauling crates down there... They are doing it in a very inneficient way, but let's get closer, c'mon.


> Oh, ok.

They both casually go down the slope, to the beach and lift a crate to help the pirates with the cargo.  It took them, basically, two trips until a hookmon stopped them.

> Hey! None o'you are part of this crew! Stop there!

> Oh yeah, we came here to help move these crates! This one is our second one so far!

> Hah! I got you now tresspassers, you won... What? You said this is your second crate???? Who are you?

> Hey, I'm Maki and this is Betamon

> HI

> We saw you guys moving these boxes and preparing your ship and thought we could help out a bit. Y'know, the system you are using is not very efficient, but if you guys are going by this then we'd better get some crates moving right?

At that point, many of the digimon who were surrouding the kids, ready to attack, had gone back to work and a mermaimon, who seemed to be some kind of guard, signaled Hookmon to just do whatever after they exchanged looks and a shrug.

> Do you know who we are, young lady?

> Oh yeah, you guys are cool pirates who have been using this cove recently to fix their ships and move cargo right? My dad also used to make stops like that in his travels.

> "Cool Pirates?" ey? Well, I would say so as well, but I wouldn't say 10 years is "recent"... But say, What'ya mean by sayin' inneficient?

> Well, for starters, you could've used a systems of pulleys to haul the crates upwards, that woud probably save y'all, like, two flights of stairs and a lot of moving time, which could be repourposed to fixing the ship too.

The mermaimon, who was bored out of her mind, stopped resting her face on her hand and got very impressed as Maki explained where to use the pulleys and what parts they could remanage to fit the new plan. By the time she was done, even Divemon was looking in awe as he could only agree with the technicalities of the architectural structure she was proposing.
After about 6 hours of of work and moving logs, the crew managed to create the necessary structure to start hauling crates up and down, but its was night already. Maki and Betamon were invited to spend the night there and eat a feast with everyone, since they actually helped a lot.
On the next day, the kids watched as the crew finished all the work and was finally ready to see them go.

> Hey kids, thanks a bunch for the help, but why? Why did you both suddenly came here and decided to help us like that?

Divemon was perplexed and it made sense, for that situation was rather odd.

> Well, actually a friend of ours told us about this place and that you guys were here. They live in the forest and...

> Who's your friend?

> Huh? Tortamon, don't you know her?

> Who? I mean, we don't really know any Tortamons who live around here... I guess there is the colony down the coast, but not here...

> Well, she did say you guys were here and were taking a long time to take off and, since I know stuff about constructing stuff and stuff. We just came to help I guess.

> Oh, wow. What a good friend then, tell her that the BrokenHull Band is grateful and that we will be much faster now.

Io and Betamon proudly stood as they watched the ship leave the cove and sail into the sea. The girl had forgotten to ask if and when they were ever coming back, but her friend advised her to forget about that, since Toratamon was coming back to claim her rightful place.
Maki and Betamon ended up meeting Tortamon not much further from where she started walking, but managed to talk to her.

> Hey Tortamon, we bring good news!!

Betamon was excited to finally have some good stories to tell and a good resolution to all those matters.

> Hehe, like Betamon said, we managed to take the pirates away... But we don't really know if they are going to come back. If you have some way to get there fast it would really good for you.

Tortamon was happy and she looked very seriously to both of her helpers

> Heh, take a couple of steps back children. I'm taking my home back!

Maki took a step back, but was pulled a couple of more meters away by Betamon, who knew better. Then, they both witnessed the giant turtle contracting her limbs and start spinning in place, to, just a few moments after, move in an incredibly fast speed towards the cove. "Yeeeeepi" she screamed as she spun away. The movement was so intense and fast, that even after taking steps back, Maki and Betamon had to run a bit backwards before Tortamon went full speed.

***

The journey back to the village was safe and it didn't take much time for the water to start flowing again. Maki and Betqamon helped dig around the area where Tortamon was staying to better accomodate the river again and spend a couple of days bonding and tyding up a small cabin in the village.
However, after a couple of days, when they were foraging for some berries near the edge of the forest, with not many objectives in mind anymore, as if Maki wasn't even trying to get back home much, she heard a faint voice, coming from the direction of the desert. "*help, heeeelp*". She ran fast, without thinking much about what could that be and was not met with deceit, but with a sad scene: A human boy, unconscius and a black agumon, which, when seeing the girl, lifted their paw in their direction and finally fainted.
